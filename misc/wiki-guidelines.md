# Guidelines for editing the wiki

## File structure

1. Each project **iteration** has its own **subfolder**
2. Pages that are related to the general project, **not iteration-specific**, go to the `misc` folder
3. The wiki root is reserved for the Home page and "meta" pages: sidebar, ...
4. Prefer short pages with a single topic to long files with multiple sections

## File naming

1. For pages that need a meaningful order, add a prefix: `01_page.md`
2. Separate prefixes with an underscore, separate words in the title with a hypen: `01_page-title-with-multiple-words`

## Sidebar and table of contents

When adding a new page, make sure to:

1. Add it to the [TOC on out Home page](/Home)
2. Add it to the [sidebar](/_sidebar)

Link pages without the extension: ~~`[My new page](./misc/my-new-page.md)`~~ `[My new page](./misc/my-new-page)`
